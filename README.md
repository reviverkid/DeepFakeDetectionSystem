## Model Architecture üß†

The Deepfake Detection System uses a combination of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. Here‚Äôs an overview:

- **CNNs:** Used for extracting spatial features from individual frames.
- **LSTM:** Used for capturing temporal dependencies across frames.

## Dataset üìö

The model is trained on a diverse dataset of real and fake videos. Some of the datasets used include:

- **DFDC (Deepfake Detection Challenge) Dataset**
- **FaceForensics++**

## Results üìä

The Deepfake Detection System achieves high accuracy in detecting deepfakes. Here are some of the key metrics:

- **Accuracy:** 78%
- **Precision:** 77%
- **Recall:** 96%

## Technical Details üõ†Ô∏è

The Deepfake Detection System leverages the following technologies and frameworks:

- **PyTorch:** For building and training the deep learning models.
- **OpenCV:** For video processing and frame extraction.
- **React:** For creating the web-based frontend interface.
- **Firebase:** For database management and user authentication.
